The file "wxBuild_wxWidgets.bat" in this directory has been updated to compile
V2.8.11 of wxWidgets for VS2010 (Visual C++ complier 10.0), VS2012
(Visual C++ complier 11.0), VS2013 (Visual C++ complier 12.0) and for
VS2015 (Visual C++ complier 14.0) 32-bit and 64-bit projects.

This file is based on that provided by RJP Computing as part of the wxPack project
(see: http://wxpack.sourceforge.net/).  It has been updated to support VS2010 and VS2012
and also 64-bit compilations for VS2005, VS2008, VS2010 and VS2012.

Note: PasswordSafe wxWidgets uses the static Unicode libraries only.

Note: In order to build the VS2015 libraries of wxwidgest 3.0.2, please ensure that
the changes of ticket 16854 have been made to the source.  See:
http://trac.wxwidgets.org/attachment/ticket/16854/msw_vc14_compiler_fixes.diff

For VS2010, the parameter xxxxx below should be vc100.
For VS2012, the parameter xxxxx below should be vc110.
For VS2013, the parameter xxxxx below should be vc120.
For VS2015, the parameter xxxxx below should be vc140.

For the 32-bit versions, you should issue the following commands in a command
window in this order:

 wxBuild_wxWidgets xxxxx NULL LIB_DEBUG_UNICODE
 wxBuild_wxWidgets xxxxx NULL LIB_RELEASE_UNICODE

The resulting libraries will be vc100_lib for VS2010, vc110_lib for VS2012
 and vc120_lib for VS2013.

For the 64-bit versions, you should issue the following commands in a command window
in this order:

 wxBuild_wxWidgets xxxxx_64 NULL LIB_DEBUG_UNICODE
 wxBuild_wxWidgets xxxxx_64 NULL LIB_RELEASE_UNICODE

The resulting libraries will be vc100_x64_lib for VS2010, vc110_x64_lib
for VS2012 and vc120_x64_lib for VS2013.

The PasswordSafe VS projects expect the static libraries to be in the wxWidgets sub-directories
\lib\vcxxx_lib and \lib\vcxxx_x64_lib for the 32-bit and 64-bit compilations respectively,
where the xxx is 100, 110, 120 or 140.  PasswordSafe does not use the DLL libraries and so there
is no need to build them for this project.

VS2005
======

If you continue to use VS2005, you should put the static libraries built by it in \lib\vc8_lib.

VS2017
======

The file "wxBuild_wxWidgets.bat" will NOT build wxWidgets for VS2017 as batch
compilation variable VS150COMNTOOLS is no longer provided. Instead please build
using the supplied solution and project files in VS2017_Project_Files.zip file,
which should be extracted into folder: "..\wxWidgets-3.0.2\build\msw".  Also,
there will be a number of C4457 warnings produced due to the new checking in VS2017.

Prior to building, set "core" as the Startup Project.

In addition, the setup.h in "..\wxWidgets-3.0.2\include\msvc\wx" needs to be updated
for VS2017 from:

    #elif _MSC_VER == 1900
        #define wxCOMPILER_PREFIX vc140
    #else
        #error "Unknown MSVC compiler version, please report to wx-dev."
    #endif

to:

    #elif _MSC_VER == 1900
        #define wxCOMPILER_PREFIX vc140
    #elif _MSC_VER == 1910
        #define wxCOMPILER_PREFIX vc141
    #else
        #error "Unknown MSVC compiler version, please report to wx-dev."
    #endif
